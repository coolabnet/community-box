Effective cooling and proper power delivery are critical for ensuring stability, longevity, and optimal performance of Raspberry Pi servers. This guide provides detailed information on power requirements, energy efficiency strategies, and cooling solutions for Raspberry Pi community server deployments.

## Power Supply Requirements

### Model-Specific Power Requirements

| Raspberry Pi Model | Voltage | Minimum Current | Recommended Current | Connector Type | Power Delivery Notes |
|-------------------|---------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 3B+ | 5V | 2.5A | 3.0A | Micro-USB | Sensitive to voltage drops |
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | 5V | 3.0A | 3.5A | USB-C | Early revisions had e-marked cable issues |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | 5V | 5.0A | 5.0A | USB-C | Higher power requirements for PCIe devices |

### Power Supply Recommendations

#### Official vs. Third-Party Power Supplies
- **Official Raspberry Pi Power Supplies**: Specifically designed for Pi requirements, providing stable power and proper current delivery
