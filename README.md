# Community Box: Comparative Study of Self-Hosting Hardware & Software for Community Networks

üåç **Project goal:**  
To provide a practical, open, evidence-based comparison of small server hardware and management software as used in community network settings. The aim is to help CCCIs select and deploy the most suitable do-it-yourself platforms for resilient, local-first content and service hosting.

## Hardware Tested
- Zimaboard
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Intel NUC

## Server/Service Management Platforms
- CasaOS
- CapRover
- Yunohost
- ZimaOS
- Balena

## Key Community Services Evaluated
- Community portal (TinaCMS/WordPress)
- Web radio (AzuraCast)
- Community movies/video library (Jellyfin)
- Internet traffic monitoring (Speedtest)
- Traffic filtering/protection (PiHole/AdGuard)
- Educational content (Kolibri)
- File storage (FileBrowser)
